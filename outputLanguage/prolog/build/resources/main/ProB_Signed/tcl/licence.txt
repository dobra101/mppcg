ProB uses state-of-the-art Prolog technology (co-routining, finite
domain constraint solvers,...) to achieve symbolic debugging,
constraint-based and temporal-logic based model checking.
The tool was partly being developed within the EPSRC grants iMoc and ABCD
and the EU grant ASAP. Further development within RODIN has been carried out.
More developments within DEPLOY, GEPAVAS, and ADVANCE are being undertaken.
Some developments have been sponsored by industrial partners.

Nauty library for symmetry reduction:

Known limitations:
==================
 - Tuple notation without parentheses a,b,c is not allowed (use (a,b,c) instead)
 - Relational composition and parallel product need to be put inside parentheses
 - The VALUES clause is not yet fully supported
 - Definitions have to be syntactically correct and have to be either an expression,
   a predicate or a substitution; the arguments have to be expressions
 - some Atelier B's tree operations are not supported (mirror, infix)
 - Preconditions of operations are not automatically propagated down
   to operations in refinements and implementations
 - Refinement checker treats PRE as SELECT
 - Possibly more (see http://www.stups.hhu.de/ProB/index.php5/Current_Limitations
   or ProB Summary in About menu for which features are supported)

Notes:
======
 - To visualize state space graphs: dot from AT&T's GraphViz package has to be installed
 - On Mac OS X you may need to install a recent version of Tcl/Tk
   (e.g., if you have no menu bar or if ProB crashes when opening a file)
 - Java 7 or newer is required for the B Parser to work
