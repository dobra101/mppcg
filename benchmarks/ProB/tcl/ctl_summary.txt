Summary of CTL Syntax supported by ProB
---------------------------------------
CTL formulas f can be constructed from:

- atomic propositions:
   { Pred } to check if a B predicate Pred holds in the current state
   e(op)    to check if an operation op is enabled

- propositional logic operators:
   not f
   f or g
   f & g
   f => g

- temporal operators:
   EX f     there is a next state satisfying f
   EX[Op] f there is a next state via Op satisfying f, e.g. EX[reset]{db={}}
   AX f     all next states satisfy f
   EF f     there exists a path where f holds in the future
   EG f     there exists a path where f holds globally
   AF f     for all paths f holds in the future
   AG f     for all paths f holds globally
   E f U g  there exists a path where f holds until g

Note: a model satisfies a CTL formula iff the formula holds in all initial states.
